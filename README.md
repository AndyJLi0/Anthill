## Description

_AntHill_ is an educational program that aims to provide an introduction to first-year level coding students who have recently learned syntax and basic principles. We provide code snippets without comments or names to describe behaviour, and students will enter Plain English descriptions of the snippet. Ollama, (specifically the Code Llama model), will generate code based on the studentâ€™s response. This code is then run against tests we have written, which provides the student with varying levels of feedback until they successfully complete the problem.
