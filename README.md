## Description

**AntHill** is an educational program that aims to provide an introduction to first-year level coding students who have recently learned syntax and basic principles. We provide code snippets without comments or names to describe behaviour, and students enter Plain English descriptions of the snippet. Ollama, (specifically the Code Llama model), will generate code based on the studentâ€™s response. This code is then run against pre-written tests, which provides the student with slight feedback until they successfully complete the problem.
